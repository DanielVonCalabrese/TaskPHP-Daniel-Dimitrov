--- Description ---
The application reads information from XML files in folders located in the xml_root_dir folder and saves it in a PostgreSQL database, after which the information from the database is visualized. At the top right of the interface I made a search form. The form allows you to search only by author name, and the result is displayed on the same page.

The main script(index.php) can be executed directly from the command line, as well as through Cron Job.

XML files contain entries in Cyrillic, Korean, and Japanese.

I used Bootstrap 4 to visualize the results and the interface of the page. I have implemented the project through OOP with several classes located in the app folder:
 - Connection - database connection class implementing Singleton design pattern.
 - AuthorsBooks - is a class that handles database queries.
 - Search - a class that realizes the search through the search form.
 - MyXMLReader - is a class through which the script goes through the directory tree and reads the information from the XML files.

Two of the conditions of the task that I wanted to have more time to be able to accomplish them are:
 - 1.2. If a record from specified file and subfolder already exists PHP script has to update the record and not to insert it as a new one.
 - 3. Result design requirements: rows should slide from left to right one after another with some small animated delay.
